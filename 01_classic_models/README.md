# ðŸ§  Classic Models â€“ Studying the GOATs

This section is dedicated to the heavy-hitters â€” the foundational models that paved the way for everything else in machine learning.

Here, Iâ€™m working through hands-on implementations of the classics:
- Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)
- Convolutional neural nets (CNNs)
- Recurrent models (RNNs)
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)

The goal isnâ€™t just to run them â€” itâ€™s to understand how and *why* they work, from the ground up.
