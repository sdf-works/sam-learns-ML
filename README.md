# sam-learns-ML
Documenting my journey from first models to modern ML systems. Come for the loss curves, stay for the interpretability.
---
Welcome to my machine learning learning lab!  
This repo is a growing collection of small, hands-on projects where I build, test, and reflect on core ML concepts — from baby’s first loss curve to custom transformers and experimental safety tools.

I know I have the technical ability to work in machine learning but that’s not always obvious on paper. So this is me proving it to you, one experiment at a time.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure (WIP)
- `classic-models/` — Linear regression, logistic regression, and MLPs
- `from-scratch/` — Building components like optimizers, layers, and attention from the ground up
- `transformer-toybox/` — Transformer explorations and interpretability experiments
- `sandbox-experiments/` — Quick tests, mini notebooks, weird ideas

## 🔍 Goals
- Build intuition for how models actually work  
- Practice reading, writing, and debugging ML code  
- Show my process publicly as I level up in model design and alignment thinking

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This is an open lab, not a finished product.  
Expect messy notebooks, TODOs, and notes-to-self — all part of the learning.
